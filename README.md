## 🎯 Emergency Types Detected

The AI can understand and classify:

- 🔥 **Fire** - Building fires, vehicle fires, wildfires
- 🌊 **Flood** - Rising water, flash floods, trapped in water
- 🌍 **Earthquake** - Ground shaking, structural damage
- 🚑 **Medical** - Cardiac arrest, unconsciousness, breathing issues
- ⚡ **Electric** - Electrocution, power line hazards
- 🩸 **Bleeding** - Severe wounds, hemorrhaging
- 🌪️ **Storm** - Tornadoes, hurricanes, severe weather
- ⛰️ **Landslide** - Mudslides, debris flows
- 💨 **Gas** - Gas leaks, toxic exposure

### Intelligent Resource Mapping

Each emergency type gets relevant nearby resources:

| Emergency Type | Resources Provided |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Fire | Fire Rescue, Fire Station, Hospital |
| Earthquake | Disaster Response, Shelter, Hospital |
| Medical | Ambulance, Hospital, Rescue Team |
| Flood | Water Rescue, Shelter, Hospital |
| Electric | Power Emergency, Ambulance, Hospital |
